/*
 * CUDA kernel template for fused block operations.
 *
 * This is a placeholder/template file to implement a real fused kernel using
 * the PyTorch C++/CUDA extension API. It is intentionally left as a stub so
 * contributors can fill in efficient device code later.
 *
 * Typical build approach (example Python snippet):
 *
 * from torch.utils.cpp_extension import load
 * fused = load(name='fused_kernels', sources=['fused_kernels.cpp', 'fused_kernels.cu'])
 *

// This file is intentionally empty - implement CUDA kernels here.
